# English to French Dictionary Translator
My vision for this project consists of enabling user interaction through a JSON file input mechanism, allowing users to input words categorised within specific groups (such as food, animals etc.) The application's functionality aims to seamlessly translate any word present in the uploaded JSON file, ensuring a comprehensive translation service aligned with the user's uploaded data

#Requirements
• An index HTML page
• JSON output to a flat file (The website provides download buttons for users to download JSON files, so the user can obtain JSON data and saves it as flat files to their device) 
• JSON input from a flat file (The website has an input box and a button for users to upload JSON files and can translate words. This means that the website can accept JSON input from flat files) 
• A single page application showing some form of interactivity
